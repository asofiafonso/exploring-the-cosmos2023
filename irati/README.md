The data was processed by filtering galaxies and using the COMBINED_FLAG,
which indicates that measurements carried out with UVIST, HSC and SC are reliable.

Then, I chose the aperture3 fluxes as features and the columns 'lp_zBEST', 'lp_age', 'lp_dust', 'lp_mass_best' and 'lp_SFR_best' as targets,
creating a new table called "galaxies_flag.fits" in the code.
